Welcome to Flair's documentation!
=================================

New: Flair can now be pip installed using 

.. code:: sh

   pip install flair-brookslab

This will install all python dependencies for basic Flair (``align``, 
``correct``, and ``collapse``). If you want to use any of the other
modules (``quantify``, ``diffExp``, or ``diffSplice``), please install
`The latest release <https://github.com/BrooksLabUCSC/flair/releases>`_.

FLAIR can be run optionally with short-read data to help increase splice
site accuracy of the long read splice junctions. FLAIR uses multiple
alignment steps and splice site filters to increase confidence in the
set of isoforms defined from noisy data. FLAIR was designed to be able
to sense subtle splicing changes in nanopore data from `Tang et
al. (2018) <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15171-6>`__.
Please read for more description of the methods.

It is recommended to combine all samples together prior to running
flair-collapse for isoform assembly by concatenating corrected read
``psl`` or ``bed`` files together. Following the creation of an isoform
reference from flair-collapse, consequent steps will assign reads from
each sample individually to isoforms of the combined assembly for
downstream analyses.

It is also good to note that ``bed12`` and ``psl`` can be converted
using
`kentUtils <https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/kentUtils/tree/master/src/hg/utils>`__
bedToPsl or pslToBed, or using ``bed_to_psl`` and
``psl_to_bed`` provided in flair's ``/bin`` directory.

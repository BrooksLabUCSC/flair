# make environment with wheel and build (only need to do this once)
python3 -m venv mytestvenv

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install wheel build

# make an account on pypi and ask the current owner (jeltje.van.baren@gmail.com as of this writing) 
# to be added to the flair-brookslab project

# create an API token (needed for safe upload), see https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken

# That file should look like this:
$ cat ~/.pypirc

  -i, --isoformtss      when specified, TSS/TES for each isoform will be
                        determined from supporting reads for individual
                        isoforms (default: not specified, determined at the

  --annotated_bed ANNOTATED_BED
                        annotation_reliant also requires a bedfile of
                        annotated isoforms; if this isn't provided, flair
                        collapse will generate the bedfile from the gtf.

                        multiple paralogs with equivalent alignment
  --predictCDS          specify if you want to predict the CDS of the final
                        isoforms. Will be output in the final bed file but not
                        the gtf file. Productivity annotation is also added in
                        the name field, which is detailed further in the

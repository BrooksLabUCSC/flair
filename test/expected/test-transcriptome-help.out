  --junction_tab JUNCTION_TAB
                        short-read junctions in SJ.out.tab format. Use this
                        option if you aligned your short-reads with STAR, STAR
                        will automatically output this file
  --junction_bed JUNCTION_BED
                        short-read junctions in bed format (can be generated
                        from long-read alignment with intronProspector)
  --junction_support JUNCTION_SUPPORT
                        if providing short-read junctions, minimum junction
                        support required to keep junction. If your junctions
                        file is in bed format, the score field will be used
                        for read support.
  --ss_window SS_WINDOW
                        window size for correcting splice sites (15)

  --sjc_support SJC_SUPPORT
                        minimum number of supporting reads for a spliced
                        isoform (1)
  --se_support SE_SUPPORT

                        isoform (3)
  --frac_support FRAC_SUPPORT
                        minimum fraction of gene locus support for isoform to
                        be called default: 0.05, only isoforms that make up
                        more than 5 percent of the gene locus are reported.
                        Set to 0 for max recall
  --no_stringent        specify if all supporting reads don't need to be full-
                        length (aligned to first and last exons of
                        transcript). Use this for fragmented libraries, but
                        understand that it will impact precision.
  --no_check_splice     don't enforce accurate alignment around splice site.
                        Specify this for libraries with high error rates, but
                        it will reduce precision
  --no_align_to_annot   related to old annotation_reliant, now specify if you
                        don't want an initial alignment to the annotated
                        sequences and only want transcript detection from the
                        genomic alignment. Will be slightly faster but less
                        accurate if the annotation is good
  -n NO_REDUNDANT, --no_redundant NO_REDUNDANT
                        For each unique splice junction chain, report options
                        include: none-- multiple supported TSSs/TESs chosen
                        for each set of splice junctions (modulated by
                        max_ends); longest--single TSS/TES chosen to maximize
                        length; best_only--single most supported TSS/TES used
                        in conjunction chosen (none)
  --max_ends MAX_ENDS   maximum number of TSS/TES picked per isoform (1) make
                        higher for more precise end detection
  --filter FILTER       Report options include: nosubset--any isoforms that
                        are a proper set of another isoform are removed;
                        bysupport--subset isoforms are removed based on
                        support; comprehensive--default set + all subset
                        isoforms; ginormous--comprehensive set + single exon
                        subset isoforms
  --quality QUALITY     minimum mapping quality threshold to consider genomic
                        alignments for defining transcripts
  --parallel_mode PARALLEL_MODE
                        parallelization mode. Default: "auto:1GB" This
                        indicates an automatic threshold where if the file is
                        less than 1GB, parallelization is done by chromosome,
                        but if it's larger, parallelization is done by region
                        of non-overlapping reads. Other modes: bychrom,
                        byregion, auto:xGB - for setting the auto threshold,
                        it must be in units of GB.
  --predict_cds         specify if you want to predict the CDS of the final
                        isoforms. Will be output in the final bed file but not
                        the gtf file. Productivity annotation is also added in
                        the name field, which is detailed further in the
                        predictProductivity documentation
  --keep_intermediate   specify if intermediate and temporary files are to be
                        kept for debugging. Intermediate files include:
                        promoter-supported reads file, read assignments to
                        firstpass isoforms
  --keep_sup            specify if you want to keep supplementary alignments
                        to define isoforms
  --end_norm_dist END_NORM_DIST
                        specify the number of basepairs to extend transcript
                        ends if you want to normalize them across transcripts
                        in a gene and extend them
  --output_endpos       specify if you want to ouptut a setparate file with
                        corrected read end positions. For development purposes
  --output_bam          output intermediate bams aligned to the transcriptome.
                        Only works with --keep_intermediate, for debugging

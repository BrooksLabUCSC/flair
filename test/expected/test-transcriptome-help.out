flair transcriptome parse options

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b GENOMEALIGNEDBAM, --genomealignedbam GENOMEALIGNEDBAM
                        Sorted and indexed bam file aligned to the genome
  -g GENOME, --genome GENOME
                        FastA of reference genome, can be minimap2 indexed
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        output file name base for FLAIR isoforms (default:
                        flair)
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        minimap2 number of threads (4)
  -f GTF, --gtf GTF     GTF annotation file, used for renaming FLAIR isoforms
                        to annotated isoforms and adjusting TSS/TESs
  --junction_tab JUNCTION_TAB
                        short-read junctions in SJ.out.tab format. Use this
                        option if you aligned your short-reads with STAR, STAR
                        will automatically output this file
  --junction_bed JUNCTION_BED
                        short-read junctions in bed format (can be generated
                        from short-read alignment with junctions_from_sam)
  --junction_support JUNCTION_SUPPORT
                        if providing short-read junctions, minimum junction
                        support required to keep junction. If your junctions
                        file is in bed format, the score field will be used
                        for read support.
  --ss_window SS_WINDOW
                        window size for correcting splice sites (15)
  -s SUPPORT, --support SUPPORT
                        minimum number of supporting reads for an isoform (3)
  --stringent           specify if all supporting reads need to be full-length
                        (spanning 25 bp of the first and last exons)
  --check_splice        enforce coverage of 4 out of 6 bp around each splice
                        site and no insertions greater than 3 bp at the splice
                        site
  -w END_WINDOW, --end_window END_WINDOW
                        window size for comparing TSS/TES (100)
  --noaligntoannot      related to old annotation_reliant, now specify if you
                        don't want an initial alignment to the annotated
                        sequences and only want transcript detection from the
                        genomic alignment. Will be slightly faster but less
                        accurate if the annotation is good
  -n NO_REDUNDANT, --no_redundant NO_REDUNDANT
                        For each unique splice junction chain, report options
                        include: none--best TSSs/TESs chosen for each unique
                        set of splice junctions; longest--single TSS/TES
                        chosen to maximize length; best_only--single most
                        supported TSS/TES used in conjunction chosen (none)
  --max_ends MAX_ENDS   maximum number of TSS/TES picked per isoform (2)
  --filter FILTER       Report options include: nosubset--any isoforms that
                        are a proper set of another isoform are removed;
                        default--subset isoforms are removed based on support;
                        comprehensive--default set + all subset isoforms;
                        ginormous--comprehensive set + single exon subset
                        isoforms
  --parallelmode PARALLELMODE
                        parallelization mode. Default: "auto:1GB" This
                        indicates an automatic threshold where if the file is
                        less than 1GB, parallelization is done by chromosome,
                        but if it's larger, parallelization is done by region
                        of non-overlapping reads. Other modes: bychrom,
                        byregion, auto:xGB - for setting the auto threshold,
                        it must be in units of GB.
  --predictCDS          specify if you want to predict the CDS of the final
                        isoforms. Will be output in the final bed file but not
                        the gtf file. Productivity annotation is also added in
                        the name field, which is detailed further in the
                        predictProductivity documentation
  --keep_intermediate   specify if intermediate and temporary files are to be
                        kept for debugging. Intermediate files include:
                        promoter-supported reads file, read assignments to
                        firstpass isoforms

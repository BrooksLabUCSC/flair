flair-correct parse options

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --junction_support JUNCTION_SUPPORT
                        if providing short-read junctions, minimum junction
                        support required to keep junction. If your junctions
                        file is in bed format, the score field will be used
                        for read support. Default=1
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        output name base (default: flair)
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        number of threads (4)
  --nvrna               specify this flag to make the strand of a read
                        consistent with the annotation during correction
  -w SS_WINDOW, --ss_window SS_WINDOW
                        window size for correcting splice sites (15)

required named arguments:
  -q QUERY, --query QUERY
                        uncorrected bed12 file

at least one of the following arguments is required:
  -f GTF, --gtf GTF     GTF annotation file
  --junction_tab JUNCTION_TAB
                        short-read junctions in SJ.out.tab format. Use this
                        option if you aligned your short-reads with STAR, STAR
                        will automatically output this file
  --junction_bed JUNCTION_BED
                        short-read junctions in bed format (can be generated
                        from short-read alignment with junctions_from_sam)

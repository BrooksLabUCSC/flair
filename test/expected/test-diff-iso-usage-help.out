                      counts_matrix_tsv colname1 colname2 outfile

Calculates the usage of each isoform as a fraction of the total expression of
the gene and compares this between samples.

positional arguments:
  counts_matrix_tsv     counts matrix TSV from flair-quantify
  colname1              the name of the column of the first sample
  colname2              the name of the column of the second sample
  outfile               output filename containing the p-value associated with
                        differential isoform usage for each isoform

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --log-stderr          also log to stderr, even when logging to syslog
  --log-level LOG_LEVEL
                        Set level to case-insensitive symbolic value, one of
                        CRITICAL, DEBUG, ERROR, FATAL, INFO, NOTSET, WARN,
                        WARNING
  --log-conf LOG_CONF   Python logging configuration file, see
                        logging.config.fileConfig()
  --log-debug           short-cut that that sets --log-stderr and --log-
                        level=DEBUG

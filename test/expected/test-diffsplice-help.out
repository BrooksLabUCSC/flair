options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Number of threads for parallel DRIMSeq (4)
  --test                Run DRIMSeq statistical testing
  --drim1 DRIM1         The minimum number of samples that have coverage over
                        an AS event inclusion/exclusion for DRIMSeq testing;
                        events with too few samples are filtered out and not
                        tested (6)
  --drim2 DRIM2         The minimum number of samples expressing the inclusion
                        of an AS event; events with too few samples are
                        filtered out and not tested (3)
  --drim3 DRIM3         The minimum number of reads covering an AS event
                        inclusion/exclusion for DRIMSeq testing, events with
                        too few samples are filtered out and not tested (15)
  --drim4 DRIM4         The minimum number of reads covering an AS event
                        inclusion for DRIMSeq testing, events with too few
                        samples are filtered out and not tested (5)
  --batch               If specified with --test, DRIMSeq will perform batch
                        correction
  --conditionA CONDITIONA
                        Implies --test. Specify one condition corresponding to
                        samples in the counts_matrix to be compared against
                        condition2; by default, the first two unique
                        conditions are used
  --conditionB CONDITIONB
                        Specify another condition corresponding to samples in
                        the counts_matrix to be compared against conditionA
  -of, --out_dir_force  Specify this argument to force overwriting of files in
                        an existing output directory

required named arguments:
  -i ISOFORMS, --isoforms ISOFORMS
                        isoforms in bed format
  -q COUNTS_MATRIX, --counts_matrix COUNTS_MATRIX
                        tab-delimited isoform count matrix from flair quantify
                        module
  -o OUT_DIR, --out_dir OUT_DIR
                        Output directory for tables and plots.

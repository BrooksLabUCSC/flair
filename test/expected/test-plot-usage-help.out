The script will produce two images, one of the isoform models and another of
the usage proportions. The most highly expressed isoforms across all the
samples will be plotted. The minor isoforms are aggregated into a gray bar.
You can toggle min_reads or color_palette to plot more isoforms.

positional arguments:
  isoforms              isoforms in bed format
  counts_matrix         isoform counts
  gene_name             Name of gene, must correspond with the gene names in
                        the isoform and counts matrix files

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o O                  prefix used for output files (default=gene_name)
  --min_reads MIN_READS
                        minimum number of total supporting reads for an
                        isoform to be visualized (default=6)
  -v VCF, --vcf VCF     VCF containing the isoform names that include each
                        variant in the last sample column
  --palette PALETTE     provide a palette file if you would like to visualize
                        more than 7 isoforms at once or change the palette
                        used. each line contains a hex color for each isoform

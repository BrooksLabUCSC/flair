# Major user-visible changes

## [2.2.0]
* Returned diffexp and diffsplice as standard modules.  The BioConda
  environment does not include the dependencies for these modules
  and required software does not run on Apple Silicon (ARM64) systems.
* The flair combine functionality is now to a module.  The
  `flair_combine` program is run with `flair combine`.
* Changed default MAPQ minimum quality score to 0. This allows more reads to
  be used in identifying isoforms, which tends to improve the overall models
  with out adversely affecting the accuracy.
* GitHub releases include the Conda YAML files for building FLAIR
  environments.  Useful if the BioConda release has not been manually
  reviewed.
* The FLAIR Docker now includes all dependencies to run diffexp and diffsplice.
* Reorganized the installation documentation

## [2.1.2] 2025-04-17
* Address issue getting BioConda to work
* Bug fixes for collapse command line parsing

## [2.1.1] 2025-04-10

## [2.1.0] 2025-03-27

* Remove `flair 123` to run multiple modules at once.
* Compatibility with Python 3.12 
* Compatibility with Apple ARM64 systems.
* Deprecated `diffExp` and `diffSplice`, they will be removed in a future release.
  Lets us know if you use this functionality.  Their dependencies are no longer
  part of the conda package, they can be added the conda environment with
  `misc/flair_diffexp_conda_env.yaml`.

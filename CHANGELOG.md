# Major user-visible changes

## [3.0.0] 2025-08-01
* General
  * Removed dependencies on pandas and rpy2.
  * Added proper logging throughout
* FLAIR align
  * Cleaned up output files - now outputs unfiltered bam and filtered bed
* FLAIR correct
  * Changed orthogonal junction inputs - now specify whether your file is 
  a bed (--junction_bed) or whether it comes from STAR short-read RNA alignment (--junction_tab)
  * Now support detecting junctions directly from long read data: 
  run intronProspector to generate junction bed, input that via --junction_bed, 
  specify desired junction read support with --junction_support
  * Removed -g genome option, increases speed
  * Now produces sorted output files
* FLAIR collapse
  * cleaned up output files, now only gives: isoforms.bed, isoforms.gtf, isoforms.fa, isoform.read.map.txt
  * (experimental) added filter for removing reads with internal priming. 
  Options: --remove_internal_priming, --intprimingthreshold, --intprimingfracAs
  * allow CDS prediction in collapse with --predictCDS
  * removed genomic range option (too fragile). For parallelization, run FLAIR transcriptome
  * made gtf (annotation) parsing more robust, especially for unsorted files 
  * improved fractional support filtering (with --support < 1)
  * improved isoform haplotyping through longshot - this is being deprecated though, please use FLAIR variants
* FLAIR quantify
  * improved fraction of reads assigned to isoforms and recovered (better handling of ambiguous alignments)
  * improved processing of multiple samples so running requires less available memory and is faster
* FLAIR diffexp and diffsplice
  * recoded directly in R to improve performance
* New modules
  * FLAIR transcriptome
    * Combines the functions of correct and collapse
    * Runs directly from and aligned bam file
    * Performs more effective parallelization (specify in --parallelmode)
  * FLAIR fusion
    * Detects gene fusions and fusion isoforms
    * Fusion detection accuracy is comparable to JAFFAL and CTAT-lr-fusion
    * Fusion isoform detection is much more accurate
  * FLAIR combine
    * Allows combining transcriptomes generated from different samples
    * Fusion isoforms can be combined with collapsed isoforms to form a full transcriptome
    * Manipulate filtering of single exon isoforms with --include_se
  * FLAIR variants
    * Allows detection of variant-aware transcripts through 
    identification of read clusters with shared variants
    * Integrates user-defined variants detected from WGS, exome sequencing, 
    or from lr-RNA-seq. Tested on WGS and lr-RNA-seq.
    * Good for identifying splicing of specific variants
    * Can be used in conjunction with FLAIR diffexp or diff_iso_usage 
    to identify changes in variant-aware transcripts between samples/groups

## [3.0.0]
* Removed dependencies on pandas and rpy2.
* Removed -g genome option from flair correct.
* Added FLAIR transcriptome module which combines the 
>>>>>>> Stashed changes


## [2.2.1] 2025-04-06
* Fixed case where --quality=0 default didn't work, as it tested for greater
  than the cutoff.
* Converted all Python code to use 4-space indentation.  Previously some code
  used tabs, other used 4-spaces.
* Added missing dependencies for plot_isoform_usage.


## [2.2.0] 2025-05-06
* Returned diffexp and diffsplice as standard modules.  The BioConda
  environment does not include the dependencies for these modules
  and required software does not run on Apple Silicon (ARM64) systems.
* The flair combine functionality is now to a module.  The
  `flair_combine` program is run with `flair combine`.
* Changed default MAPQ minimum quality score to 0. This allows more reads to
  be used in identifying isoforms, which tends to improve the overall models
  with out adversely affecting the accuracy.
* GitHub releases include the Conda YAML files for building FLAIR
  environments.  Useful if the BioConda release has not been manually
  reviewed.
* The FLAIR Docker now includes all dependencies to run diffexp and diffsplice.
* Reorganized the installation documentation.
* Fixed flair_quantify --output_bam crash
* Other bug fixes

## [2.1.2] 2025-04-17
* Address issue getting BioConda to work
* Bug fixes for collapse command line parsing

## [2.1.1] 2025-04-10
* converted all programs to use console scripts to allow BioConda to work

## [2.1.0] 2025-03-27
* Numerous bug fixes.
* Removed support for PSL format.
* Remove `flair 123` to run multiple modules at once.
* Compatibility with Python 3.12 
* Compatibility with Apple ARM64 systems.
* Deprecated `diffExp` and `diffSplice`, they will be removed in a future release.
  Lets us know if you use this functionality.  Their dependencies are no longer
  part of the conda package, they can be added the conda environment with
  `misc/flair_diffexp_conda_env.yaml`.

flair collapse don't check params at the end: Collapse unrecognized arguments: ---stringent

with --no_gtf_end_adjustment make sure a gtf is actually given, otherwise it's redundant

find out why no_redundant bestonly (to collapse_isoforms_precise.py) is not different from none

fix the color field in flair collapse(?)

fix the block count (done?)
collapse_annotation_reliant_generate_checksplice.isoforms.bed

collapse_support_fract.isoforms.bed (ONLY!) has a 13th field. Just, what.

bed_to_gtf dies if the last gene has only one tx

make an argument parser for running in 123 mode, maybe output instructions for continuing.

see if corrected.bed can be output as correctly sorted

add single exon genes with ORFs to test input annotation.gtf
